## Challenge description

> Bash challenges consisted of a series of linux puzzles reminding us the [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) or Nebula wargames.
> 
> Access to each challenge were done via SSH using the flag of the previous level as the password for the next one:
> 
> ```
> ssh challenges.auctf.com -p 30040 -l level1
> ```

## Challenges resolution
### Level 1

The level 1 was just an intro to show the principle as the flag was stored on the `README` file:

![level1 flag](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level1-flag.png)

```
auctf{W3lcoM3_2_da_C7F}
```

### Level 2
For the level 2, the following `random_dirs.sh` bash script was presented:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

x=$RANDOM

base64 flag.txt > /tmp/$x
function finish {
        rm  /tmp/$x
}
trap finish EXIT

sleep 15
```

The 15 seconds delay gave us just enough time to consult the latest file created by the `level3` user, and stored in the `tmp` folder:

```
level2@652f811058fe:/tmp$ cat 21495
YXVjdGZ7ZzB0dEBfbXV2X2Zhczd9Cg==
```

The base64 decoded output revealed the flag:

![level2 flag](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level2-flag.png)

```
auctf{g0tt@_muv_fas7}
```

### Level 3

The level3's home folder contained the following files: 

![listing](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level3-listing.png)

The file we were interested in here was the `passcodes.sh` bash script:

![passcodes.sh](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level3-passcodes.sh.png)

`$RANDOM` is a bash function that returns a random signed 16 bit integer (from 0 through 32767).

Furthermore, this same script was granted the right to be launched via the `sudo` command:

![level3 sudo](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level3-sudo.png)

We can thus bruteforce this generated number using the following command in order to retrieved the flag:

![level3 flag](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level3-flag.png)

```
auctf{wut_r_d33z_RaNdom_numz}
```

### Level 4

For the level 4, the following `print_file.sh` bash script was given:

![print_file.sh](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level4-print_file.sh.png)

Same as before, the `sudo -l` command revealed that level4 user can run the `print_file.sh` script as the user `level5`:

![level4 sudo](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level4-sudo.png)

We were thus able to simply retrieve the flag with the `sudo -u level5` command:

![level4 flag](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level4-flag.png)

```
auctf{FunKy_P3rm1ssi0nZ}
```

### Level 5

The final level consisted of the following `portforce.sh` bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

x=$(shuf -i 1024-65500 -n 1)
echo "Guess the listening port"
input=$(nc -lp $x)
echo "That was easy right? :)"
cat flag.txt
```

While running the `portforce.sh` script, the `netstat` command enabled us to list the latest binded port:

![netstat](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level5-netstat.png)

We were finally rewarded with the flag by connecting to the identified port using `netcat`:

![level5 flag](/assets/AUCTF-20-chall_bash-level5-flag.png)

```
auctf{n3tc@_purt_$can}
